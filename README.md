# CRUD
This is a CRUD app in which we can create a task, update it and delete it just like a "Todo list".
This app is made through node, express and postgres modules of npm.

Steps to implement the project:
1.Setup all the node env.
2.create a database in postgres with "id" and "title" as columns name.
3.run the index.js file.(before running change the database name and password in line no. 11 and 12 in index.js)
